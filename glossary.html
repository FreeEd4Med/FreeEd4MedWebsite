          <h3>Assuagement</h3>
          <p><strong>Assuagement</strong> — the act of making something burdensome or painful less intense or severe, such as grief or pain.</p>
          <p>Usage: We use the term to describe the clinical and emotional goals of music interventions — practices and tracks that reduce the intensity of experiences like anxiety or pain.</p>

          <h3>Music mixing</h3>
          <p><strong>Music mixing</strong> — the stage where individual recorded tracks (vocals, instruments, pads, percussion) are balanced, EQ'd, panned, and processed so they work together as a coherent stereo or immersive mix. Mixing choices shape how clear, intimate, or spacious a track feels.</p>

          <h3>Music mastering</h3>
          <p><strong>Music mastering</strong> — the final polishing step after mixing. Mastering focuses on overall tonal balance, perceived loudness, and delivery format preparation (streaming, CD, clinical playback), often using EQ, multiband compression, limiting, and loudness metering to achieve consistent results across playback systems.</p>
          <p>For clinical or streaming delivery we recommend preparing a -14 LUFS preview and a master file with stems available where possible.</p>

          <h3>Loudness (LUFS) & metering</h3>
          <p><strong>LUFS</strong> (Loudness Units relative to Full Scale) is the modern standard for measuring perceived loudness. Streaming platforms normalize tracks to target LUFS levels (commonly around -14 LUFS for many services), so mastering to a platform-appropriate loudness helps protect dynamics and listener comfort.</p>

          <h3>Audio compression</h3>
          <p><strong>Compression</strong> reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal so quieter parts become more audible and louder peaks are controlled. Used tastefully it can make a track feel more intimate and steady; over-compression removes emotional dynamics and can be fatiguing.</p>
          <p>Common settings vary by genre — master-bus limiting should be conservative for healing playlists so transient detail and expressivity remain intact.</p>

          <h3>Psychoacoustics</h3>
          <p><strong>Psychoacoustics</strong> is the study of how humans perceive sound — pitch, loudness, spatial location, timbre, and how sounds interact in the ear and brain. Understanding basic psychoacoustic principles helps craft music that soothes, reduces perceived pain, or supports relaxation.</p>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Masking</h3>
          <p><strong>Masking</strong> occurs when one sound makes another harder to hear (for example loud noise masking a quiet voice). In mixing/mastering, careful EQ and level choices reduce masking and keep important elements (a voice or calming motif) audible at bedside or on low-quality playback devices.</p>

          <h3>Audiogram</h3>
          <p>An <strong>audiogram</strong> is a chart of hearing sensitivity across frequencies — a clinical tool used to characterize hearing loss. Understanding audiograms helps clinicians and sound designers make music accessible (e.g., emphasize mid‑range vocal clarity for those with high‑frequency loss).</p>

          <h3>Ear anatomy</h3>
          <p>Quick primer: the hearing system includes the outer ear (collects sound), middle ear (mechanical transfer through ossicles), and inner ear (cochlea — converts vibration into nerve signals). Damage or changes at any level affect how sound is perceived and which frequencies should be emphasized or avoided in therapeutic music.</p>
          <p>For accessibility consider providing mixed stems, clear vocals, alternate mixes with wider dynamics, and compatible formats for clinicians to use.</p>
