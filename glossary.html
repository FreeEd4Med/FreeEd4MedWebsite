          <h3>Parameter & processor quick reference</h3>

          <dl>
            <dt>ADSR</dt>
            <dd>Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release — envelope controls that shape amplitude over time.</dd>

            <dt>Compressor: threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, makeup gain</dt>

          <h3>Mastering, delivery, and clinical guidance</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Types of mastering</dt>
            <dd>Standard stereo mastering (final stereo file), stem mastering (grouped elements) and format‑specific masters (vinyl vs streaming).</dd>

            <dt>Metering: Peak, RMS, LUFS</dt>
            <dd>Peaks measure instantaneous amplitude; RMS is average energy; LUFS measures perceived loudness and is important for streaming normalization (typical target ≈ −14 LUFS for many platforms).</dd>

            <dt>Dynamic Range / Signal‑to‑Noise ratio (SNR)</dt>
            <dd>Dynamic range is the difference between quiet and loud passages; SNR measures signal versus background noise — both critical for clinical intelligibility on varied devices.</dd>

            <dt>Dithering</dt>
            <dd>Adds low-level noise when reducing bit depth to avoid quantization artifacts and preserve perceived detail.</dd>

            <dt>Metadata (ID3, ISRC)</dt>
            <dd>Embedding metadata ensures correct attribution, distribution tracking, and clinical cataloging; include clear licensing and intended use notes when donating tracks.</dd>

            <dt>Listening safety</dt>
            <dd>For clinical use prefer moderate listening levels, avoid fatiguing loudness, and provide stems/preview masters to enable local tailoring by clinicians.</dd>

            <dt>Masking (clinical)</dt>
            <dd>External or competing sounds that obscure therapeutic material; consider quieter clinical environments, headphone mixes, or EQ to avoid masking patient‑important elements.</dd>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Clipping (hard / soft)</h3>
          <p>When a signal exceeds the maximum level and the waveform is flattened. Hard clipping produces harsh distortion; soft clipping introduces gentler harmonics that can sometimes be used musically but risk damaging quality if overdone.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Bit depth</h3>
          <p>Determines the resolution of each audio sample and therefore the dynamic range and noise floor (e.g., 16‑bit vs 24‑bit). Higher bit depth reduces quantization noise and is preferred during recording and mixing.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Sample rate</h3>
          <p>How many times per second an audio waveform is sampled (Hz/kHz). Common values: 44.1 kHz (CD), 48 kHz (video), 96 kHz (high‑resolution). Higher rates capture higher frequencies but increase file size.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Dithering</h3>
          <p>A small, controlled noise added when reducing bit depth (e.g., 24→16 bit) to prevent quantization distortion and preserve perceived audio quality in quieter passages.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>File formats (WAV / FLAC / MP3)</h3>
          <p>WAV/AIFF: lossless, uncompressed masters for delivery. FLAC: lossless but smaller, good for downloads. MP3/AAC: compressed lossy formats for streaming and distribution where file size matters.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Stems & multitracks</h3>
          <p>Stems are grouped submixes (e.g., drums, vocals), while multitracks are all individual recorded tracks. Providing stems is useful for stem‑mastering and clinical or remix needs.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Bus / Submix</h3>
          <p>A routing path where multiple tracks are combined (e.g., drum bus). Processing (EQ/compression) on a bus affects all routed tracks and is a powerful way to achieve coherent tone and dynamics.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Equalization (EQ)</h3>
          <p>Shaping tonal balance by boosting/cutting frequency bands. Types include parametric (select frequency, Q), shelving (boost/cut above/below a frequency), and notch (very narrow cut for problem frequencies).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Filter types (HP / LP / BP / Notch)</h3>
          <p>High‑pass (HP) removes low frequencies; low‑pass (LP) removes high frequencies; band‑pass (BP) allows a band through; notch removes a narrow band. Useful for cleaning rumble, removing hiss, or hunting resonances.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Q / bandwidth</h3>
          <p>Controls the width of an EQ band; higher Q is narrower and surgical, lower Q is wider and gentler. Use Q to leave space for other elements while reducing masking.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Transient</h3>
          <p>A brief, high‑energy onset of a sound (attack of a drum or pluck). Transients are important for perceived clarity and punch — preserve or shape them intentionally using transient shapers or compressors.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Compressor parameters: threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, makeup gain</h3>
          <p>Threshold sets when compression starts; ratio sets how much reduction; attack/release control timing; knee softens the onset; makeup gain restores level after gain reduction. Thoughtful settings keep dynamics expressive while controlling peaks.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Limiter / brickwall limiter</h3>
          <p>A limiter prevents the output from exceeding a ceiling; brickwall limiters act as an absolute ceiling to prevent intersample overs. Use sparingly to preserve dynamics and listening comfort.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Sidechain</h3>
          <p>A routing technique where one signal (e.g., kick) controls processing on another track (e.g., compressing bass when kick hits) to make space and avoid masking.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Metering: peak, RMS, LUFS</h3>
          <p>Peak measures instantaneous highest samples; RMS measures average energy; LUFS measures perceived loudness over time and is used for streaming normalization. Master to platform targets (commonly −14 LUFS for many services).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Normalization</h3>
          <p>Process that adjusts the overall level to meet a target peak or average — does not change dynamics or transient behavior beyond gain change.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Stereo field / panning / width</h3>
          <p>Placement of sounds left or right and the immersive width of the mix. Panning and width tools help separate elements and create a sense of space while maintaining focus for clinical listening (clear center for vocals).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Phase & time alignment</h3>
          <p>When two similar signals are out of phase they can cancel (comb filtering). Time‑aligning and phase correction keep multi‑mic setups and layered tracks coherent and full.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Reverb & delay (dry / wet)</h3>
          <p>Reverb simulates room reflections; delay repeats a sound over time. Dry/wet controls the mix between unprocessed and processed signal. For therapeutic music, prefer warm, gentle reverb and modest decay to avoid drowning important vocal material.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Saturation & harmonic distortion</h3>
          <p>Soft saturation adds pleasant harmonics (warmth) and perceived loudness; excessive distortion destroys clarity and should be avoided for healing playlists where comfort and intelligibility are priorities.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Noise gate</h3>
          <p>A processor that mutes signals below a set threshold — useful to clean room noise between phrases but can sound unnatural if thresholds are set too aggressively.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Reference track</h3>

          <h3>Dynamic range & signal‑to‑noise ratio</h3>
          <p>Dynamic range is the difference between quiet and loud passages; signal‑to‑noise ratio compares desired audio to background noise. For therapeutic tracks keep useful dynamic range while ensuring important details remain audible on quiet hospital devices.</p>
