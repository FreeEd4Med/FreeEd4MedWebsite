          <h3>Assuagement</h3>
          <p><strong>Assuagement</strong> — the reduction in intensity or severity of an unwanted experience (pain, anxiety, grief), often the primary clinical aim of music interventions. In this project it describes the emotional and physiological easing targeted by curated musical materials.</p>
        </article>

        
            <dt>Air</dt>
            <dd>High‑frequency content above ~12 kHz that creates a sense of openness and detail. Commonly enhanced with gentle EQ boosts or exciters to add polish and perceived clarity without raising harshness.</dd>

            <dt>Body</dt>
            <dd>Perceived fullness in the midrange (typically ~200–600 Hz) that gives instruments and vocals weight and presence in the mix. Lack of body can make elements sound thin or distant.</dd>

            <dt>Boomy</dt>
            <dd>An over‑emphasis of low and low‑mid frequencies which produces excessive sustain or rumble (often felt rather than precisely heard). Boomy mixes usually benefit from targeted cuts in the 40–160 Hz region and tighter transient shaping.</dd>

            <dt>Boxy</dt>
            <dd>A constricted, honky quality caused by an excess of energy in the low‑mid band (≈200–800 Hz) that makes sounds lose clarity and feel congested. Surgical mid cuts and careful mic placement normally remedy it.</dd>

            <dt>Chug</dt>
            <dd>A punchy, percussive midrange character often heard in rhythmic guitars or muted riffs; prized in rock/metal for forward‑pushing rhythm but best balanced to avoid masking other mid instruments.</dd>

            <dt>Cloudiness</dt>
            <dd>Excess low‑mid buildup (≈200–500 Hz) that softens transients and reduces separation — similar to 'muddy' but used to describe a diffuse, unfocused density across the mix.</dd>

            <dt>Muddy</dt>
            <dd>A mix condition where low‑mid energy masks detail and intelligibility, causing a lack of clarity; often cured by subtractive EQ and improved instrument separation.</dd>

            <dt>Creaminess</dt>
            <dd>A smooth, rounded tonal balance with pleasant midrange sweetness, frequently achieved with gentle harmonic saturation and warm compression.</dd>

            <dt>Crunchy</dt>
            <dd>A slightly broken‑up, harmonically rich texture produced by overdrive, aggressive saturation, or tight compression — useful for character but can be fatiguing if excessive.</dd>

            <dt>Ratty</dt>
            <dd>A gritty, harsh texture often caused by excessive high‑mid distortion, clipping or poor processing; usually an undesirable by‑product of over‑processing.</dd>

            <dt>Fatiguing</dt>
            <dd>A listening quality caused by repeated exposure often due to excess high‑mid energy or over‑compression, leading to listener discomfort over time.</dd>

            <dt>Fizz</dt>
            <dd>An exaggerated upper high‑mid shimmer (lower treble) that can make cymbals and vocals 'sparkly' but becomes harsh or sibilant when overdone.</dd>

            <dt>Glue</dt>
            <dd>A perceptual sense of cohesiveness between mix elements often achieved with subtle bus compression, balancing, and harmonic blending that makes tracks feel like one piece.</dd>

            <dt>Growl</dt>
            <dd>A low, throaty distortion character used to add weight or grit (commonly on bass or low synths).</dd>

            <dt>Snarl</dt>
            <dd>A higher‑mid aggressive character similar to growl but brighter and more biting; often used on guitars or edgy vocal lines.</dd>

            <dt>Hiss</dt>
            <dd>Non‑musical high‑frequency noise without a defined pitch (tape hiss, electronics). Typically reduced with noise‑reduction tools in post‑production.</dd>

            <dt>Honky / Nasal / Pinched</dt>
            <dd>Midrange emphasis (≈400 Hz–1 kHz) that produces a thin, nasal coloration typically corrected with surgical cuts or bandwidth‑adjusted EQ.</dd>

            <dt>Lift</dt>
            <dd>A deliberate light boost in the very high frequencies (≈10–16 kHz) to impart air and shimmer—apply gently to avoid exaggerated sibilance or harshness.</dd>

            <dt>Presence</dt>
            <dd>An upper‑mid frequency focus (≈2–6 kHz) that helps vocals and lead instruments cut through and remain intelligible in dense mixes.</dd>

            <dt>Punchiness</dt>
            <dd>Sensation of attack and impact produced by transient strength and frequency balance, often shaped with transient designers, compression and EQ.</dd>

            <dt>Pumping</dt>
            <dd>Short bursts of audible level fluctuation caused by a compressor or limiter responding to loud elements; can be intentional (creative) or an unwanted artifact of misconfigured dynamics processing.</dd>

            <dt>Richness</dt>
            <dd>A full, harmonically complex tonality with pleasing overtone content across frequencies, often perceived as 'fuller' sound.</dd>

            <!-- 'Ring' is defined technically below under 'Common mixing and signal terms' to avoid duplicate entries. -->

            <dt>Silkiness</dt>
            <dd>A smooth, delicate treble quality that adds perceived refinement without harshness; often associated with high‑quality analog or subtle processing.</dd>

            <dt>Warmth</dt>
            <dd>A pleasing low/mid emphasis and subtle harmonic coloration that contributes to a comfortable, rounded tonal character.</dd>

            <dt>Subbiness / Subby</dt>
            <dd>Excessive infrasonic or subwoofer-frequency energy (typically <60 Hz) that can cloud mixes and cause imbalance on small playback systems.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p class="seealso">For technical details on resonant ringing see <a href="#term-ring">Resonant peaks / Ring</a> under <em>Common mixing and signal terms</em>.</p>

          <h3>Mastering, delivery, and clinical guidance</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Types of mastering</dt>
            <dd>Standard stereo mastering (final stereo file), stem mastering (grouped elements) and format‑specific masters (vinyl vs streaming).</dd>

            <dt>Metering: Peak, RMS, LUFS</dt>
            <dd>Peaks measure instantaneous amplitude; RMS is average energy; LUFS measures perceived loudness and is important for streaming normalization (typical target ≈ −14 LUFS for many platforms).</dd>

            <dt>Dynamic Range / Signal‑to‑Noise ratio (SNR)</dt>
            <dd>Dynamic range is the difference between quiet and loud passages; SNR measures signal versus background noise — both critical for clinical intelligibility on varied devices.</dd>

            <dt>Dithering</dt>
            <dd>Adds low-level noise when reducing bit depth to avoid quantization artifacts and preserve perceived detail.</dd>

            <dt>Metadata (ID3, ISRC)</dt>
            <dd>Embedding metadata ensures correct attribution, distribution tracking, and clinical cataloging; include clear licensing and intended use notes when donating tracks.</dd>

            <dt>Listening safety</dt>
            <dd>For clinical use prefer moderate listening levels, avoid fatiguing loudness, and provide stems/preview masters to enable local tailoring by clinicians.</dd>

          <h3>Clinical & hearing terms</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Audiogram</dt>
            <dd>A clinical chart that plots hearing sensitivity by frequency; useful when adapting music for patients with hearing loss.</dd>

            <dt>Cochlea / Ear anatomy</dt>
            <dd>Basic hearing anatomy: outer ear → middle ear (ossicles) → inner ear (cochlea) — pathologies at different levels affect frequency perception and intelligibility.</dd>

            <dt>Masking (clinical)</dt>
            <dd>External or competing sounds that obscure therapeutic material; consider quieter clinical environments, headphone mixes, or EQ to avoid masking patient‑important elements.</dd>
          </dl>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Neuro-acoustic & neurodivergent terms</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Stochastic Resonance</dt>
            <dd>A phenomenon where adding moderate noise to a system enhances the detection of weak signals. In ADHD contexts, external auditory noise may help weak dopaminergic signals cross neural thresholds, improving attention and cognitive performance.</dd>

            <dt>Moderate Brain Arousal (MBA) Model</dt>
            <dd>A theoretical framework suggesting that ADHD brains are understimulated at baseline. External noise (pink, brown, white) can raise arousal to optimal levels for attention, explaining why some individuals with ADHD focus better with background sound.</dd>

            <dt>Predictive Coding Theory</dt>
            <dd>A neuroscience model proposing the brain constantly generates predictions about incoming sensory data. In ASD, prediction errors may be weighted differently, causing unpredictable stimuli to be more distressing — explaining the preference for highly structured, predictable music.</dd>

            <dt>Hyperacusis</dt>
            <dd>Heightened sensitivity to everyday sounds, common in ASD populations. Music for hyperacusis-sensitive listeners should avoid sudden transients, high-frequency harshness, and unpredictable dynamic changes; consider low-pass filtering around 4-5 kHz.</dd>

            <dt>Sensory Gating</dt>
            <dd>The brain's ability to filter irrelevant sensory information. Reduced sensory gating in ADHD and ASD can make filtering background noise difficult, affecting how therapeutic music should be designed for these populations.</dd>

            <dt>White Noise</dt>
            <dd>Broadband noise with equal energy across all frequencies (flat spectrum). Can sound harsh due to high-frequency content; useful for masking but may be fatiguing for extended listening. Better suited for short focus bursts than long study sessions.</dd>

            <dt>Pink Noise</dt>
            <dd>Noise with equal energy per octave, resulting in reduced high frequencies compared to white noise (−3 dB/octave roll-off). More comfortable for extended listening; often preferred for ADHD focus applications and sleep environments.</dd>

            <dt>Brown Noise (Brownian/Red Noise)</dt>
            <dd>Low-frequency-emphasized noise with steep high-frequency roll-off (−6 dB/octave). Resembles rumbling or distant thunder; particularly soothing for sensory-sensitive individuals and useful as a calming foundation layer in ASD-focused music.</dd>

            <dt>Brainwave Entrainment</dt>
            <dd>The phenomenon where neural oscillations synchronize to external rhythmic stimuli. Used therapeutically with isochronic tones or binaural beats to influence brain states: beta (14-30 Hz) for alertness, alpha (8-12 Hz) for relaxation, theta (4-8 Hz) for meditation.</dd>

            <dt>Binaural Beats</dt>
            <dd>An auditory illusion created when two slightly different frequencies are presented to each ear separately (requires headphones). The brain perceives a third "beat" at the difference frequency, potentially influencing brainwave states.</dd>

            <dt>Isochronic Tones</dt>
            <dd>Regular, evenly-spaced pulses of sound that create rhythmic amplitude modulation. Unlike binaural beats, isochronic tones work through speakers and may produce cleaner entrainment. Beta-range (14-18 Hz) pulses may support ADHD focus.</dd>

            <dt>Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)</dt>
            <dd>An evidence-based treatment system using music to address neurological conditions including stroke, Parkinson's, traumatic brain injury, and developmental disorders. NMT techniques include Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation and Musical Attention Training.</dd>

            <dt>Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS)</dt>
            <dd>An NMT technique using rhythm to entrain and improve movement patterns, particularly gait rehabilitation. Requires metronomically stable tempo and clear rhythmic markers; tempo can be gradually adjusted to improve walking speed and symmetry.</dd>

            <dt>Lo-Fi / Chillhop</dt>
            <dd>Music genres characterized by relaxed tempos (70-90 BPM), warm analog textures, subtle vinyl crackle, and jazzy chord progressions. Popular for study/focus contexts; the moderate complexity and steady rhythm may support ADHD concentration without overstimulation.</dd>

            <dt>Transient (in ASD context)</dt>
            <dd>Sudden, sharp sound onsets (attacks) that can trigger startle responses in sensory-sensitive individuals. For ASD-friendly music, minimize high-transient instruments like bells, staccato strings, or sharp percussion attacks.</dd>

          <h3>Clipping (hard / soft)</h3>
          <p>When a signal exceeds the maximum level and the waveform is flattened. Hard clipping produces harsh distortion; soft clipping introduces gentler harmonics that can sometimes be used musically but risk damaging quality if overdone.</p>

          <h3>File formats (WAV / FLAC / MP3)</h3>
          <p>WAV/AIFF: lossless, uncompressed masters for delivery. FLAC: lossless but smaller, good for downloads. MP3/AAC: compressed lossy formats for streaming and distribution where file size matters.</p>
        </article>

          <h3>Stems & multitracks</h3>
          <p>Stems are grouped submixes (e.g., drums, vocals), while multitracks are all individual recorded tracks. Providing stems is useful for stem‑mastering and clinical or remix needs.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Bus / Submix</h3>
          <p>A routing path where multiple tracks are combined (e.g., drum bus). Processing (EQ/compression) on a bus affects all routed tracks and is a powerful way to achieve coherent tone and dynamics.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Equalization (EQ)</h3>
          <p>Shaping tonal balance by boosting/cutting frequency bands. Types include parametric (select frequency, Q), shelving (boost/cut above/below a frequency), and notch (very narrow cut for problem frequencies).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Filter types (HP / LP / BP / Notch)</h3>
          <p>High‑pass (HP) removes low frequencies; low‑pass (LP) removes high frequencies; band‑pass (BP) allows a band through; notch removes a narrow band. Useful for cleaning rumble, removing hiss, or hunting resonances.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Q / bandwidth</h3>
          <p>Controls the width of an EQ band; higher Q is narrower and surgical, lower Q is wider and gentler. Use Q to leave space for other elements while reducing masking.</p>

          <h3>Transient</h3>
          <p>A brief, high‑energy onset of a sound (attack of a drum or pluck). Transients are important for perceived clarity and punch — preserve or shape them intentionally using transient shapers or compressors.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Compressor parameters: threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, makeup gain</h3>
          <p>Threshold sets when compression starts; ratio sets how much reduction; attack/release control timing; knee softens the onset; makeup gain restores level after gain reduction. Thoughtful settings keep dynamics expressive while controlling peaks.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Limiter / brickwall limiter</h3>
          <p>A limiter prevents the output from exceeding a ceiling; brickwall limiters act as an absolute ceiling to prevent intersample overs. Use sparingly to preserve dynamics and listening comfort.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Sidechain</h3>
          <p>A routing technique where one signal (e.g., kick) controls processing on another track (e.g., compressing bass when kick hits) to make space and avoid masking.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Metering: peak, RMS, LUFS</h3>
          <p>Peak measures instantaneous highest samples; RMS measures average energy; LUFS measures perceived loudness over time and is used for streaming normalization. Master to platform targets (commonly −14 LUFS for many services).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Normalization</h3>
          <p>Process that adjusts the overall level to meet a target peak or average — does not change dynamics or transient behavior beyond gain change.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Stereo field / panning / width</h3>
          <p>Placement of sounds left or right and the immersive width of the mix. Panning and width tools help separate elements and create a sense of space while maintaining focus for clinical listening (clear center for vocals).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Phase & time alignment</h3>
          <p>When two similar signals are out of phase they can cancel (comb filtering). Time‑aligning and phase correction keep multi‑mic setups and layered tracks coherent and full.</p>
        </article>

        <p>Reverb simulates room reflections; delay repeats a sound over time. Dry/wet controls the mix between unprocessed and processed signal. For therapeutic music, prefer warm, gentle reverb and modest decay to avoid drowning important vocal material.</p>
        </article>

        <p>Soft saturation adds pleasant harmonics (warmth) and perceived loudness; excessive distortion destroys clarity and should be avoided for healing playlists where comfort and intelligibility are priorities.</p>
        </article>

        <p>A processor that mutes signals below a set threshold — useful to clean room noise between phrases but can sound unnatural if thresholds are set too aggressively.</p>
        </article>

        <p>A professionally mixed/mastered track used as a target for tonal balance, width, and loudness during mixing and mastering. Use genre‑appropriate references to keep expectations realistic.</p>
        </article>

        <p>Reflections and room modes color recordings. Treatment or careful mic placement reduces resonant peaks that can make a mix sound muddy or boomy — especially important when music will be used in clinical environments with variable playback systems.</p>
        </article>

        <p>Dynamic range is the difference between quiet and loud passages; signal‑to‑noise ratio compares desired audio to background noise. For therapeutic tracks keep useful dynamic range while ensuring important details remain audible on quiet hospital devices.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Metadata: ID3 & ISRC</h3>
          <p>Embedded metadata (artist, title, track number, ISRC codes) helps distribution, identification, and clinical cataloging. Include clear licensing and intended‑use notes when donating tracks for clinical use.</p>
        </article>

        <p>For clinical or bedside playback prefer moderate volumes and limited durations. Avoid fatiguing levels and highly compressed masters — provide softer preview masters and stems if clinicians need customization.</p>
