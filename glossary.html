          <h3>Assuagement</h3>
          <p><strong>Assuagement</strong> — the act of making something burdensome or painful less intense or severe, such as grief or pain.</p>
          <p>Usage: We use the term to describe the clinical and emotional goals of music interventions — practices and tracks that reduce the intensity of experiences like anxiety or pain.</p>

          <h3>Music mixing</h3>
          <p><strong>Music mixing</strong> — the stage where individual recorded tracks (vocals, instruments, pads, percussion) are balanced, EQ'd, panned, and processed so they work together as a coherent stereo or immersive mix. Mixing choices shape how clear, intimate, or spacious a track feels.</p>

          <h3>Music mastering</h3>
          <p><strong>Music mastering</strong> — the final polishing step after mixing. Mastering focuses on overall tonal balance, perceived loudness, and delivery format preparation (streaming, CD, clinical playback), often using EQ, multiband compression, limiting, and loudness metering to achieve consistent results across playback systems.</p>
          <p>For clinical or streaming delivery we recommend preparing a -14 LUFS preview and a master file with stems available where possible.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Loudness (LUFS) & metering</h3>
          <p><strong>LUFS</strong> (Loudness Units relative to Full Scale) is the modern standard for measuring perceived loudness. Streaming platforms normalize tracks to target LUFS levels (commonly around -14 LUFS for many services), so mastering to a platform-appropriate loudness helps protect dynamics and listener comfort.</p>

          <h3>Audio compression</h3>
          <p><strong>Compression</strong> reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal so quieter parts become more audible and louder peaks are controlled. Used tastefully it can make a track feel more intimate and steady; over-compression removes emotional dynamics and can be fatiguing.</p>
          <p>Common settings vary by genre — master-bus limiting should be conservative for healing playlists so transient detail and expressivity remain intact.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Psychoacoustics</h3>
          <p><strong>Psychoacoustics</strong> is the study of how humans perceive sound — pitch, loudness, spatial location, timbre, and how sounds interact in the ear and brain. Understanding basic psychoacoustic principles helps craft music that soothes, reduces perceived pain, or supports relaxation.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Masking</h3>
          <p><strong>Masking</strong> occurs when one sound makes another harder to hear (for example loud noise masking a quiet voice). In mixing/mastering, careful EQ and level choices reduce masking and keep important elements (a voice or calming motif) audible at bedside or on low-quality playback devices.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Audiogram</h3>
          <p>An <strong>audiogram</strong> is a chart of hearing sensitivity across frequencies — a clinical tool used to characterize hearing loss. Understanding audiograms helps clinicians and sound designers make music accessible (e.g., emphasize mid‑range vocal clarity for those with high‑frequency loss).</p>

          <h3>Ear anatomy</h3>
          <p>Quick primer: the hearing system includes the outer ear (collects sound), middle ear (mechanical transfer through ossicles), and inner ear (cochlea — converts vibration into nerve signals). Damage or changes at any level affect how sound is perceived and which frequencies should be emphasized or avoided in therapeutic music.</p>
          <p>For accessibility consider providing mixed stems, clear vocals, alternate mixes with wider dynamics, and compatible formats for clinicians to use.</p>

        <h2>Mixing & Mastering — expanded terms</h2>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Gain staging</h3>
          <p>Balancing signal levels throughout the recording and mixing chain so each stage has enough level to be above noise but not so hot it clips. Good gain staging preserves headroom and keeps converters and plugins happy.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Headroom</h3>
          <p>The safety margin between normal operating levels and the digital clipping point (0 dBFS). Leave headroom in mixes so peaks don’t clip and mastering can adjust loudness safely.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Clipping (hard / soft)</h3>
          <p>When a signal exceeds the maximum level and the waveform is flattened. Hard clipping produces harsh distortion; soft clipping introduces gentler harmonics that can sometimes be used musically but risk damaging quality if overdone.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Bit depth</h3>
          <p>Determines the resolution of each audio sample and therefore the dynamic range and noise floor (e.g., 16‑bit vs 24‑bit). Higher bit depth reduces quantization noise and is preferred during recording and mixing.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Sample rate</h3>
          <p>How many times per second an audio waveform is sampled (Hz/kHz). Common values: 44.1 kHz (CD), 48 kHz (video), 96 kHz (high‑resolution). Higher rates capture higher frequencies but increase file size.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Dithering</h3>
          <p>A small, controlled noise added when reducing bit depth (e.g., 24→16 bit) to prevent quantization distortion and preserve perceived audio quality in quieter passages.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>File formats (WAV / FLAC / MP3)</h3>
          <p>WAV/AIFF: lossless, uncompressed masters for delivery. FLAC: lossless but smaller, good for downloads. MP3/AAC: compressed lossy formats for streaming and distribution where file size matters.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Stems & multitracks</h3>
          <p>Stems are grouped submixes (e.g., drums, vocals), while multitracks are all individual recorded tracks. Providing stems is useful for stem‑mastering and clinical or remix needs.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Bus / Submix</h3>
          <p>A routing path where multiple tracks are combined (e.g., drum bus). Processing (EQ/compression) on a bus affects all routed tracks and is a powerful way to achieve coherent tone and dynamics.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Equalization (EQ)</h3>
          <p>Shaping tonal balance by boosting/cutting frequency bands. Types include parametric (select frequency, Q), shelving (boost/cut above/below a frequency), and notch (very narrow cut for problem frequencies).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Filter types (HP / LP / BP / Notch)</h3>
          <p>High‑pass (HP) removes low frequencies; low‑pass (LP) removes high frequencies; band‑pass (BP) allows a band through; notch removes a narrow band. Useful for cleaning rumble, removing hiss, or hunting resonances.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Q / bandwidth</h3>
          <p>Controls the width of an EQ band; higher Q is narrower and surgical, lower Q is wider and gentler. Use Q to leave space for other elements while reducing masking.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Transient</h3>
          <p>A brief, high‑energy onset of a sound (attack of a drum or pluck). Transients are important for perceived clarity and punch — preserve or shape them intentionally using transient shapers or compressors.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Compressor parameters: threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, makeup gain</h3>
          <p>Threshold sets when compression starts; ratio sets how much reduction; attack/release control timing; knee softens the onset; makeup gain restores level after gain reduction. Thoughtful settings keep dynamics expressive while controlling peaks.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Limiter / brickwall limiter</h3>
          <p>A limiter prevents the output from exceeding a ceiling; brickwall limiters act as an absolute ceiling to prevent intersample overs. Use sparingly to preserve dynamics and listening comfort.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Sidechain</h3>
          <p>A routing technique where one signal (e.g., kick) controls processing on another track (e.g., compressing bass when kick hits) to make space and avoid masking.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Metering: peak, RMS, LUFS</h3>
          <p>Peak measures instantaneous highest samples; RMS measures average energy; LUFS measures perceived loudness over time and is used for streaming normalization. Master to platform targets (commonly −14 LUFS for many services).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Normalization</h3>
          <p>Process that adjusts the overall level to meet a target peak or average — does not change dynamics or transient behavior beyond gain change.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Stereo field / panning / width</h3>
          <p>Placement of sounds left or right and the immersive width of the mix. Panning and width tools help separate elements and create a sense of space while maintaining focus for clinical listening (clear center for vocals).</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Phase & time alignment</h3>
          <p>When two similar signals are out of phase they can cancel (comb filtering). Time‑aligning and phase correction keep multi‑mic setups and layered tracks coherent and full.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Reverb & delay (dry / wet)</h3>
          <p>Reverb simulates room reflections; delay repeats a sound over time. Dry/wet controls the mix between unprocessed and processed signal. For therapeutic music, prefer warm, gentle reverb and modest decay to avoid drowning important vocal material.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Saturation & harmonic distortion</h3>
          <p>Soft saturation adds pleasant harmonics (warmth) and perceived loudness; excessive distortion destroys clarity and should be avoided for healing playlists where comfort and intelligibility are priorities.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Noise gate</h3>
          <p>A processor that mutes signals below a set threshold — useful to clean room noise between phrases but can sound unnatural if thresholds are set too aggressively.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Reference track</h3>
          <p>A professionally mixed/mastered track used as a target for tonal balance, width, and loudness during mixing and mastering. Use genre‑appropriate references to keep expectations realistic.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Room acoustics, resonance, and standing waves</h3>
          <p>Reflections and room modes color recordings. Treatment or careful mic placement reduces resonant peaks that can make a mix sound muddy or boomy — especially important when music will be used in clinical environments with variable playback systems.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Dynamic range & signal‑to‑noise ratio</h3>
          <p>Dynamic range is the difference between quiet and loud passages; signal‑to‑noise ratio compares desired audio to background noise. For therapeutic tracks keep useful dynamic range while ensuring important details remain audible on quiet hospital devices.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Metadata: ID3 & ISRC</h3>
          <p>Embedded metadata (artist, title, track number, ISRC codes) helps distribution, identification, and clinical cataloging. Include clear licensing and intended‑use notes when donating tracks for clinical use.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="entry">
          <h3>Listening safety & recommended practice</h3>
          <p>For clinical or bedside playback prefer moderate volumes and limited durations. Avoid fatiguing levels and highly compressed masters — provide softer preview masters and stems if clinicians need customization.</p>
