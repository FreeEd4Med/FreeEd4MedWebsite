          <h3>Mas‑Herrero, et al. — A causal role for the prefrontal cortex in music‑induced reward (J. Neuroscience, 2021)</h3>
          <p class="meta">DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0727-20.2020" target="_blank">10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0727-20.2020</a> • Full text: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084325/" target="_blank">PMC8084325 (Free)</a></p>
          <p>This combined TMS + fMRI study probed the causal role of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in music‑induced pleasure and motivation. Stimulation of dlPFC produced bidirectional changes in music reward responses and modulated nucleus accumbens activation and fronto‑auditory functional connectivity.</p>
          <p>Strengths include a causal neuromodulatory manipulation and multimodal imaging tying cortical control to subcortical reward circuitry. Limitations are lab‑based short sessions and moderate sample size, which constrain direct clinical translation but support targeted music interventions and neuromodulatory synergy.</p>

          <h3>Gold, Pearce, et al. — Pleasurable music modulates reinforcement learning (Frontiers in Psychology, 2013)</h3>
          <p class="meta">DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00541" target="_blank">10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00541</a> • Full text: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748532/" target="_blank">PMC3748532 (Free)</a></p>
          <p>Behavioral experiments showed that listening to pleasurable music can bias reinforcement learning performance in a probabilistic selection task. Effects varied with musical experience, supporting a link between music reward and dopaminergic learning processes.</p>
          <p>Well‑designed behavioral study with clear hypotheses and careful consideration of individual differences; however, neurochemical mechanisms are inferred rather than directly measured. Useful for designing music‑based therapies that aim to reinforce adaptive behaviors.</p>

          <h3>Bradt & Dileo — Music interventions for preoperative anxiety (Cochrane Review, 2013 update)</h3>
          <p class="meta">DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006908.pub2" target="_blank">10.1002/14651858.CD006908.pub2</a> • Full text: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758540/" target="_blank">PMC9758540 (Free)</a></p>
          <p>The Cochrane meta‑analysis pooled 26 randomized trials (N≈2,051) and found a moderate reduction in preoperative anxiety with music listening versus standard care. While heterogeneity existed across studies, the overall effect supports music as a low‑risk anxiolytic adjunct in perioperative settings.</p>
          <p>Rigorous review methodology and a clinically applicable finding are major strengths. Study heterogeneity and variable trial quality temper interpretations but justify offering music listening as a pragmatic non‑pharmacologic option in preoperative care.</p>

          <h3>Palmer, et al. — Brief music intervention reduces preoperative anxiety (J Clin Oncol, 2015)</h3>
          <p class="meta">DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2014.59.6049" target="_blank">10.1200/JCO.2014.59.6049</a> • Full text: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4979095/" target="_blank">PMC4979095 (Free)</a></p>
          <p>In a pragmatic randomized trial (n≈201) a single 5‑minute patient‑preferred music session (live or recorded) reduced preoperative anxiety vs usual care, with live music also linked to quicker immediate recovery. The trial demonstrates that very brief, preference‑matched music has measurable perioperative benefits.</p>
          <p>Strengths are sample size, pragmatic design, and clinically meaningful outcomes. Limitations include short‑term assessment and potential placebo effects due to lack of blinding; still, results support integrating short music interventions into perioperative workflows.</p>

          <h3>Werner, et al. — Sensorimotor synchronization to music reduces pain (PLOS One, 2023)</h3>
          <p class="meta">DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287950" target="_blank">10.1371/journal.pone.0287950</a> • Full text: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10381080/" target="_blank">PMC10381080 (Free)</a></p>
          <p>Experimental evidence shows that active sensorimotor synchronization to music (moving in time with music) yields larger pain reductions than passive listening or silence, indicating that embodied music engagement develops distinct analgesic effects beyond auditory exposure.</p>
          <p>Well‑constructed experimental manipulation highlighting movement + music synergy. Limitations include laboratory pain models and short follow‑up, so translation to chronic or palliative pain must be done carefully, but the study motivates somatic music interventions in clinic and rehab.</p>
