    "Slow sonic textures: bell-like piano with soft pad underneath, 64 BPM, simple four-bar loop.",
    "Hushed synth choir and pad, 56 BPM, intentional spaces between phrases to encourage slower breathing.",
    "Gently evolving pad piece with field-recording textures (soft rain), 58 BPM, avoid percussion peaks.",
    "Ambient lull, 65 BPM, sparse harmonic changes, long note tails to support relaxation.",
    "Soft harmonic drone with occasional melodic motif, 50–60 BPM, balanced stereo field for calming immersion.",
    "Minimalist track for sleeping/relaxation: low dynamics, 55 BPM, gentle pad and breath-like synth swells.",

  "breath_centered": [
    "Create a 4 minute ambient track where phrasing guides a 4–6 second inhale/exhale rhythm, 60 BPM with long swells on the pad.",
    "Breath-centered background: soft flute-like lead, 60 BPM, swells timed to 4s inhale/4s exhale, low reverb.",
    "Slow cinematic pad with crescendo/decrescendo shaped to 4-second cycles; add subtle bell at phrase start.",
    "Breath-friendly ambient: 5-second inhale swells, 5-second exhale decay; sparse harp arpeggios.",
    "Gentle piano with hold sustain timed to 4s breathing, low-frequency grounding sub pad, 58 BPM equivalent.",
    "Guide breathing track—soft vocal hums in background timed for 6-second cycles; no lyrics, simple harmonic progression.",
    "Minimal percussion (soft shakers) placed at exhale to ease the release, 60 BPM, pads with long attack and release.",
    "Create an audio signal with rising contours (inhale) and falling contours (exhale) that lasts 3–5 minutes, 4s inhale 6s exhale optional.",
    "Ambient field recording (ocean) blended with pad swells shaped to breath pacing; mix low to avoid startling dynamics.",
    "Sustained string pad with slow LFO amplitude shaping at 0.1–0.2 Hz to roughly match slow breathing.",
    "Simple guided music background: soft voice count cues (optional) with padded chords timed to breaths.",
    "Low-mid emphasis on the mix with gentle binaural width to create intimate breathing space."

  "movement_pain_modulation": [
    "Create a 3 minute gentle rhythmic track, 70 BPM, soft kick on 1 & 3, hand percussion (shakers), warm pad, strong pulse for easy synchronization.",
    "A movement piece at 60 BPM with 16-bar sections, gentle bass groove, light snare brushes, loopable 30s excerpt for repetitive exercises.",
    "Slow syncopated groove at 58 BPM, swing like a gentle rocking — emphasize consistent downbeat for safe movement.",
    "Tap-friendly motif, 64 BPM, focused on a short 20–40s extract with clear rhythmic markers and steady tempo.",
    "Soft electronic pulsing at 65 BPM with small crescendos to cue movement, provide BPM and stems.",
    "Gentle walking pulse, 70 BPM, percussive elements low in mix, round tonal center to avoid abrupt changes.",
    "Minimal voice-count percussion cues with subtle melodic underpinning to guide simple motion at 60 BPM.",
    "Use a steady 1–2 per bar motif that’s easy for non-musicians to follow when tapping or swaying.",
    "Create a loopable 30s section with strong, soft beat and a clear 4/4 structure for mobile app synchronization.",
    "Tone-based movement track: bass pulse at 60 BPM, light melodic counterpoint, designed for movement rehabilitation.",
    "Bedside movement music: 68 BPM, warm acoustic rhythm guitar, low percussion, stems provided for app integration.",
    "Synchronized group movement track: 64 BPM, clear downbeat markers, gentle crescendo markers for guided sessions."
