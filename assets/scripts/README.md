# Scripts / utilities

This folder holds small helper scripts used by our workflow. Replace placeholders with your real scripts or upload binaries.

- `ardour_fixer.sh` — placeholder script used to illustrate the Apps page. Replace with your actual script.
- `make_pdfs.py` — a helper to generate very simple single-page PDFs from text (keeps site self-contained).
