# Scripts / utilities

This folder holds small helper scripts used by our workflow. Replace placeholders with your real scripts or upload binaries.

- `ardour_fixer.py` — Python utility used to automate common Ardour project fixes (preferred). See `requirements.txt` for dependencies and the script's header for usage notes.
- `make_pdfs.py` — a helper to generate very simple single-page PDFs from text (keeps site self-contained).
