"A causal role for the prefrontal cortex in music-induced reward","Mas-Herrero et al.",2021,"J Neurosci","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0727-20.2020","PMC8084325","neuroscience;reward;TMS;fMRI","TMS + fMRI showed left dlPFC causally modulates music-induced pleasure and motivation; changes in nucleus accumbens activity and fronto-auditory connectivity explain differences in liking vs wanting.","Strong causal evidence linking cortical control to subcortical reward circuitry; laboratory setting and short sessions limit direct clinical translation."
"Pleasurable music modulates reinforcement learning","Gold, Pearce, et al.",2013,"Frontiers in Psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00541","PMC3748532","learning;reinforcement;behavior;music","Pleasurable music biased reinforcement learning in a probabilistic selection task; effects depended on musical experience and listening style.","Clear behavioral evidence linking music reward to learning processes; no direct neurochemical measures and limited ecological validity."
"Music interventions for preoperative anxiety (Cochrane Review)","Bradt & Dileo",2013,"Cochrane Database","10.1002/14651858.CD006908.pub2","PMC9758540","anxiety;preoperative;meta-analysis;perioperative","Meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials found music listening reduced preoperative anxiety with a moderate effect size.","Rigorous review methods with clinically relevant findings; heterogeneity across trials and variable study quality temper conclusions."
"A brief music intervention reduces preoperative anxiety","Palmer et al.",2015,"J Clin Oncol","10.1200/JCO.2014.59.6049","PMC4979095","anxiety;preoperative;RCT;patient-preferred","RCT (n≈201) showed a single 5-minute patient-preferred music session reduced preoperative anxiety; live music sometimes improved immediate recovery.","Pragmatic design and meaningful outcomes; short-term follow-up and potential expectancy effects are limitations."
"Sensorimotor synchronization to music reduces pain","Werner et al.",2023,"PLOS One","10.1371/journal.pone.0287950","PMC10381080","pain;sensorimotor;movement;synchronization","Active synchronization (moving with music) produced larger pain reductions than passive listening or silence.","Good experimental control and clear effect; lab models limit direct clinical translation to chronic/palliative populations."
