MadMooze — Sample Stems Pack (Demo)

This small demo stems pack illustrates how to prepare and label stems for clinical/streaming use.

Contents (demo placeholders):
- 01_drone_vocals_stem.wav    (lead vocal - placeholder)
- 02_pad_stem.wav            (sustained ambient pad)
- 03_perc_stem.wav           (light percussion)
- 04_bass_stem.wav           (subtle bass / low pad)
- mix_preview.mp3            (low-bitrate preview for quick audition)

Notes for artists:
- Provide stems as WAV or FLAC (lossless preferred) at 44.1 or 48 kHz, 24-bit.
- Include a README.txt describing the stems, intended use, and suggested tempo (BPM).
- Provide licensing info (see LICENSE.txt) and any restrictions for clinical or app use.

If you want help producing a full stems package (real audio files and zips) we can prepare a sample SAR (stems archive) and embed it on your multimedia page.
