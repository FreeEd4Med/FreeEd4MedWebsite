        <h3>Songs of Love Foundation — how to request, donate, or volunteer</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Songs of Love Foundation</strong> creates free, personalized songs for children and seniors facing health challenges. They accept song requests, welcome volunteer songwriters, and accept donations to support their mission.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://songsoflove.org/request-a-free-song/" target="_blank">Request a free song</a> — send a personalized song request for a child or senior in need.</li>
          <li><a href="https://songsoflove.org/become-a-songs-of-love-songwriter/" target="_blank">Become a Songwriter</a> — volunteer your talents to write songs for recipients.</li>
          <li><a href="https://songsoflove.org/donate/" target="_blank">Donate</a> — support their programs and outreach.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you'd like to collaborate with FreeEd4Med as an artist — donate time, student workshops, or offer to create specialized tracks — <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we'll coordinate with Songs of Love and clinical partners.</p>

        <h3>Example playlists (recommended for bedside, preoperative, or pain relief)</h3>
        <p>Below are suggested playlist themes. For copyright reasons, we provide examples as themes and guidance rather than hosted tracks. To add tracks you own or that are public domain, ask us to add an embedded playlist.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Calm & Grounding</strong> — slow tempos (50–70 bpm), soft pads, sustained strings, light piano motifs.</li>
          <li><strong>Breath‑Centered Relaxation</strong> — phrasing that supports 4–6 second inhale/exhale pacing, steady slow pulse.</li>
          <li><strong>Memories & Comfort</strong> — familiar melodic motifs, lyric references to names and memories (works well for Songs of Love personalization).</li>
          <li><strong>Movement & Pain Modulation</strong> — rhythmic but gentle tracks suited for tapping/swaying and synchronization exercises.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Would you like us to craft an example stems pack or a public playlist that matches your artist voice? We can make one and embed it here — tell us your preferred streaming platform and permission settings.</p>
